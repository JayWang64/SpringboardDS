I downloaded the assignmenet database and loaded them locally on my own MS SQL 2016 server.

Sorry, I didn't realize the springboard mySQL server was version 5, which doesn't support CTE's (Common Table Expressions).

I will revisit / rewrite with subqueries and fix minor syntax nuances if time allows but otherwise am comfortable moving forward.
