Can you count something interesting?


Can you find trends (e.g. high, low, increasing, decreasing, anomalies)?

- how to get around the pct of pct problem? (other than getting more granular data)
- nba api?

1) Can you make a bar plot or a histogram?

home/away

>> bar plot
regular vs. post season
- total wins
- home wins only


>> box plots

Regular Season
	home: 
		fg, ft, 3p pcts
	away:
		fg, ft, 3p pcts

Post Season		
	home: 
		fg, ft, 3p pcts
	away:
		fg, ft, 3p pcts


2) Can you compare two related quantities? Can you make a scatterplot?

Home Team Wins vs. Total Wins

4) Can you make a time-series plot?
over each season

Regular Season
	line graph:
		(home + away):
			pts, asts, reb
Post Season:

- total pts, ast, reb
