In early 2015, Taarifa organization partnered with the Tanzanian Ministry of Water and Data Driven to launch a Data Science competition: “Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table”. 
The goal of the contest is to accurately predict the operating status of each pump in the test dataset - ‘functional’, ‘functional needs repair’ or ‘non functional’.

The social benefit of developing a machine learning model to accurately predict the status of these pumps is to improve the efficiency of maintenance and operations which will ultimately ensure high availability and reliability of clean, drinkable water in communities across Tanzania. As of 2020, 4 million people lack access to safe water and another 30 million don’t have access to improved sanitation .

As a result, the interested parties for the results of this study could be government officials or engineers/operators who must manage the resources of maintaining the pumps and of course the citizens themselves who rely on the pumps to meet their water needs.

Additional motivation draws from my personal background of a Chemical Engineer where I have designed and sized pumps (albeit for industrial use) and hope apply my learnings to similar problems that the oil and gas industry might come across: preventative maintenance of equipment and efficient deployment of resources to minimize unexpected plant shutdowns.
