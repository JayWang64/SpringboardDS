Proposal
In early March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the suspension of the 2019-20 NBA season (about 60% complete). After more than 2 months of uncertainty, the NBA announced that the season would resume starting July 30 2020 albeit in a condensed format with a reduced number of teams and games to be played out before continuing on to the playoffs under the traditional 16 team format - all within the Disney “bubble” in Orlando, Florida.

But what if the season didn’t continue? Could the Toronto Raptors (who won their first championship last season) repeat as NBA Champions? How well could a machine learning model predict the winners of an NBA game? To answer this question, I will attempt to train a model that can predict a single game winner. Followed by having the 2019 playoff bracket fed into the trained model in order to predict the eventual playoff champion.

The motivation behind this project primarily draws from my personal interest - being an NBA and Raptors fan. There may also be interested parties within: sports betting (free or paid), NBA data analysts or even other NBA fans. Sports betting individuals will use the results differently for each party: bet takers will want to adjust odds, spreads, and payouts while bet makers will want to put their money where they can win. Ultimately both parties may seek an edge to ensure maximum profitability.
